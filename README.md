# Argo Data repository for argopy

This repository hold example data for the [argopy](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy) library (e.g., as used in the documentation and unit testing) that would bloat the main repository if included there.

## Data update

We probably need some kind of utility function to keep this repo sub-sample in sync with the GDAC FTP content.
