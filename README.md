# argopy-data
Data repository for argopy examples and tests

This repository exists to hold example data for [argopy](https://github.com/euroargodev/argopy) (e.g., as used in the documentation and unit testing) that would bloat the main repository if included there.

(strategy borrowed from [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org))
